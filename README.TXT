# Sudoku Solver
I wrote this project in BlueJ while I was in high school. I wanted to prepare for a Lockheed Martin coding competition, so I completed this project on my own time. The program can accurately solve any Sudoku puzzle. I worked on it for over a month, experimenting with different solutions and trying to teach myself how to solve the problem. I got to the point where the program could solve a few Sudoku puzzles but was too inefficient (timed out) for larger puzzles. In the end I ended up experimenting with functions that called themselves, and I taught myself recursion. This was the last tool I needed to solve the problem.
